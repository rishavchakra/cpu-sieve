	abstract = {This paper presents and characterizes the Princeton Application
	            Repository for Shared-Memory Computers (PARSEC), a benchmark suite
	            for studies of Chip-Multiprocessors (CMPs). Previous available
	            benchmarks for multiprocessors have focused on high-performance
	            computing applications and used a limited number of synchronization
	            methods. PARSEC includes emerging applications in recognition,
	            mining and synthesis (RMS) as well as systems applications which
	            mimic large-scale multithreaded commercial programs. Our
	            characterization shows that the benchmark suite covers a wide
	            spectrum of working sets, locality, data sharing, synchronization
	            and off-chip traffic. The benchmark suite has been made available
	            to the public.},
